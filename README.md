# LocalisationDemoApp
A demo applicaiton written in Swift 5 for iOS devices, this demos how developer can change application languge form the application itself. It reloads the current sccreen after language selection. 

please refer to the video, this shows how we can change language from the application without changing system region.

Though String Values are not localised properly but I ensure that these getting pulled from proper source string file based on your selection.
